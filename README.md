A python interface for the Arcade Learning Environment

This provides a python library to interface with the arcade learning environment that can be found here:
http://www.arcadelearningenvironment.org/

This library hooks into the shared object file for the arcade learning environment and bypasses using the slower FIFO interface.
It is designed to be fast. Example code is provided that demonstrates an agent that can be controlled from the keyboard.

Installation instructions and documentation for using it can be found on the github wiki linked below:
